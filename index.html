        <p>Special Thanks
A big Thank you to Abishiek Veeramalla for his inspiring demo projects. This is my first project, and the journey has just begun!

I took Kunal Verma's project as a reference, implementing similar functionality by having my project listen on port 3000 through an .env fileâ€”just like he did. Your contributions have been invaluable in getting me started.</p>
